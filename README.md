# 🌐 MCP Servers Collection

This repository is a **community-driven collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**.
Our mission: build an ecosystem of MCP servers that AI models can use as **routes for trained intents** — starting with **text classification** and expanding further.

By contributing an MCP server, you’re helping create a playground of tools that allow AI systems to **do more, faster, and smarter**. 🚀

## 📋 Available MCP Servers

Here’s the current list of MCP servers included in this repository:

### 1. [TSX Vibe-Coding Tools MCP Server](servers/mcp-tsx-generator/README.md)

An MCP server that enables AI assistants to generate **production-ready React/TSX components** with:

* Context awareness of your project structure
* Intelligent component generation
* Support for templates, forms, and project analysis
  
📖 Full details: see [its README](servers/mcp-tsx-generator/README.md)

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! 

🎉 Adding your own MCP server is simple:

1. Copy the template at [`servers/example-mcp-server`](servers/example-mcp-server)
2. Rename it (e.g., `servers/my-mcp-server`)
3. Implement your server logic in `src/index.tsx`
4. Document it in its own `README.md`
5. Submit a Pull Request ✅

## 🎯 Why Contribute?

* **Open-source impact**: Help build the largest collection of MCP servers available.
* **LLM playground**: Your MCP server can become a route for AI models trained on text classification intents.
* **Developer collaboration**: Share tools that others can integrate and improve.
* **Future of AI-native dev**: Shape how AI assistants interact with projects and tools.

## 🌱 Additional Information

We also maintain a **platform for fine-tuning DistilBERT** to understand user input as **intent classification**.
Each intent is then mapped to an MCP server, making it possible to route user input into:

* **Data**
* **Information**
* **Knowledge**
* **Actions**

This means the more MCP servers the community contributes, the richer the ecosystem becomes — empowering both **AI assistants** and **developers** to do more with natural language. 🚀
